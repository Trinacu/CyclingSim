in Design ImPlot screen, there is something about “Define a generic Metric system for observers”.
“Make observers composable (filters, downsampling)”
"Add async / background execution safely"

in general the chat "Design ImPlot screen" has a lot of stuff that could be added ...

there seems to be a bit of a bug with the "can't change screen - sim running" because
it triggers without asking for screen change sometimes

bug with displaying course when its just flat - or maybe even with any long flat section?

what do we do when riders cross the line? we need to log their times and make them such that they skip updates
and ideally keep their relative position (first finisher is furthers along? - or is this unnecessary?)
actually exclude them from sorting also - and group management

"can't change screen - sim is runnning." - triggering when you dont even request to switch
i think when going back and forth between sim and plot screen
