in Design ImPlot screen, there is something about “Define a generic Metric system for observers”.
“Make observers composable (filters, downsampling)”
"Add async / background execution safely"

in general the chat "Design ImPlot screen" has a lot of stuff that could be added ...

there seems to be a bit of a bug with the "can't change screen - sim running" because
it triggers without asking for screen change sometimes
