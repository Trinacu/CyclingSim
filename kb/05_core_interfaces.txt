Key abstract / conceptual interfaces
  ICourseView
    Read-only view of course geometry
  SimulationObserver
    Receives callbacks during simulation
  SimulationEndCondition
    Decides when to stop offline runs
  Drawable
    Renderable entity (world or UI)

Responsibilities
  Simulation
    Time evolution and control
  PhysicsEngine
    Rider updates
  Renderer
    Visualization only
  Observers
    Data extraction without influencing simulation

Lifecycle expectations
  Simulation outlives renderers
  Snapshots are valid only within a frame
  Observers are externally owned
  UI widgets are recreated per screen
