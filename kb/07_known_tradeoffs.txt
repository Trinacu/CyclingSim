Numerical limits
  Newton iteration assumes:
    Reasonable initial speed guess
    Smooth power curves
  Extremely steep slopes or near-zero speed can:
    Slow convergence
    Produce large inertia terms
These are monitored but not fully guarded against.

Simplifications by design
  No lateral dynamics
  No rider collisions
  No braking model
  No fatigue accumulation (yet)
  No drivetrain dynamics beyond scalar loss

These omissions keep:
  The state space small
  The simulation inspectable
  The math debuggable

They are conscious tradeoffs, not oversights.

Determinism vs realism
The system favors:
  Deterministic results
  Reproducible runs
  Debug-friendly behavior

Over:
  Stochastic realism
  Noisy inputs
  Emergent chaos

This is especially important for offline analysis and plotting.

Time & precision tradeoffs
  Fixed timestep simplifies:
    Integration
    Interpolation
    Observer logic
  Precision is improved by:
    Smaller dt
    Substepping
    Better solvers
Not by variable dt in the main loop.

Rendering tradeoffs
  CPU-side interpolation favors clarity over GPU efficiency
  Sprite-based riders limit pose realism
  Camera smoothing is intentionally conservative

Visual correctness is secondary to temporal correctness.

Known “good enough” zones
The simulation behaves best when:
  Speeds are in realistic cycling ranges
  Slopes are moderate (<15%)
  Time acceleration is reasonable (<50×)
Outside these ranges, results may still be stable, but less meaningful.

Final note
These tradeoffs are not permanent.
They are stakes in the ground that allow the project to grow coherently.
