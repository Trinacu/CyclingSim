Render loop overview

Per frame:
  Collect latest published snapshots
  Compute interpolation factor alpha
  Build an InterpolatedFrameView
  Update camera
  Render world drawables
  Render UI drawables
  Render ImGui overlays

Snapshot & interpolation strategy
Double-buffered snapshots:
  prev_frame
  curr_frame
Renderer never reads live physics state
Interpolation is linear per attribute:
  value = prev * (1 - alpha) + curr * alpha

This guarantees tear-free rendering.

GPU / CPU responsibilities
CPU
  Physics
  Snapshot building
  Camera transforms
  UI layout

GPU
  Sprite rendering
  Line rendering (course)
  ImGui / ImPlot drawing

No compute work is delegated to the GPU.
