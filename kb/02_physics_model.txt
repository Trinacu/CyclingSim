Core model

Each rider is modeled as a point mass with:
  Power input (from effort × FTP)
  Resistive forces:
    Aerodynamic drag
    Rolling resistance
    Bearing losses
    Gravity
    Inertia
    Drivetrain loss

Speed is solved implicitly from power balance.

Integration strategy
Fixed timestep: Δt = 0.1 s but can be adjusted
Position integration:
  pos += speed * dt

Speed is solved using Newton iteration on the power equation:
  P_required(v) = P_available

Householder iteration exists but is currently secondary.

Fixed vs variable timestep
  Physics: fixed timestep
  Rendering: variable timestep with interpolation
  Offline simulation: fixed timestep loop without sleeping

This avoids numerical instability and spiral-of-death issues.

Assumptions & invariants
Course slope is piecewise constant
Riders never move backward
Mass, CdA, and bike parameters are constant per rider
No collisions or drafting yet (future extension point)
