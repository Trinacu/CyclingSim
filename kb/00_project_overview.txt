Project Overview
================

This is a C++ physics simulation project using SDL3.

What the project is

This project is a real-time and offline cycling simulation engine with a visual frontend.
It simulates riders moving along a course under physically motivated forces (aerodynamics, gravity, rolling resistance, inertia), while rendering the result interactively using SDL.

The project intentionally separates:
  Simulation (physics + time evolution)
  Visualization (camera, interpolation, rendering)
  UI & interaction (widgets, ImGui overlays)
  Offline analysis (metric observers, plotting)

The simulation can run:
  In real time on a dedicated physics thread
  In offline / accelerated mode for analysis and plotting

What it is not
  Not a game engine with gameplay logic, AI opponents, or networking
  Not a fully validated scientific model or training simulator
  Not a UI framework — UI code exists only to support simulation inspection
  Not tied to real-world GPS, maps, or race rules
  Accuracy is pursued, but architectural clarity and inspectability take priority.

Constraints & philosophy
Performance
  Physics runs at a fixed timestep (but it could be changed to be variable later)
  Rendering runs independently at a display-driven rate (≈60 FPS)
  Lock contention is minimized by snapshotting

Architecture
  Clear ownership boundaries
  One-way dependencies (simulation → snapshot → rendering)
  No renderer ever mutates simulation state

Philosophy
  Deterministic simulation
  Explicit data flow
  Debuggability over cleverness
  Prefer simple, inspectable math to opaque optimizations
