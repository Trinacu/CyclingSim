Drafting & group dynamics
Drafting and group behavior are explicitly not baked into the core physics loop.
This is intentional.

Recommended extension point:
  Introduce a group analysis pass after each fixed physics step
  Groups are derived from snapshot state (positions, speeds), not stored in riders
  Aerodynamic effects are applied via:
    A temporary CdA factor modifier
    Reset every physics step

Key rule:
  Never let group state become authoritative simulation state.

Groups should be:
  Ephemeral
  Recomputed each step
  Deterministic given rider positions
This avoids long-lived coupling, hysteresis bugs, and ordering artifacts.

Drafting implementation sketch (future)
  Build groups using 1D proximity (course position)
  Assign ordered leader → follower relationships
  Apply CdA reduction only to followers
  Clamp maximum benefit to avoid runaway effects

Physics loop remains:
  update riders
  → analyze groups
  → apply modifiers
  → next step

AI & decision-making hooks
Rider “intelligence” should not live inside Rider::update().

Instead:
Introduce a decision layer that:
  Reads snapshots
  Outputs intent (effort targets, strategy flags)
Decisions are applied via:
  set_effort(uid, value)

This allows:
  Human input
  Scripted strategies
  Learned policies
  Offline experimentation
The physics engine remains agnostic.

Extension safety rules
  AI must be deterministic for a given input sequence
  No random sampling inside physics
  No UI callbacks inside simulation threads
  All modifiers must be reversible each step
